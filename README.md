### Who-Call-Me

It is public demo version of corporate program integrated with contact centre
VoIP phone station for indentificate incoming call. And, if need, search
in customer base.

Short say, it is mini web full-stack application for medium-corporate
contact-centre. (Uff... I wrote it looooong definition, and you readed.)

Program writed with Angular2 and ExpressoJS frameworks with using my
implementation JSON remote procedure calls. Deep into the program work
splendid PostgreSQL under KnexJS.

Scope of program around 40 page of source code, with lot of alone code
brackets on string. I am joking about brackets, nevertheless it is very
important to have a readable code.

Program also include simple component for user autentification and user
management.

Demo version include fake customer database with 100.000 records. Into
real use-case the customer base include over 700.000 records. And into
real use-case the program have some addition into code for safe work and
data verification.
